## Design

### Principles

- Alignment
- Contrast
- Layering
- Consistency
  - Slide numbers may be useful, but make them gray so they don't draw attention.
- Visualization
- Acknowledgment

### Basic Layout

- Keep simple(Do not clutter with logos)
- Keep a consistent style
  - Black text, white background // Bright text, dark background
  - Same fonts, same colors, same size/weight for the same thing

### Fonts

- Use a sans-serif font

  - Sans-serif font provides better readability for short text blocks

    Serif font is ergonomic for large text block

- PowerPoint : Calibri

- Code : `Courier bold`

- Arial / Arial Narrow is less attractive

- Use only onw or two fonts and be consistent

### Equations

- Mathtype or Texpoint is recommended (especially for complicated equations)

### Colors

- Pick a few colors and stick with them (consistency)  

- For text colors, Avoid fully saturated colors and choose the somewhat desaturated ones

- Try to use HSL to select colors

- Choose warm colors for texts and cool colors for backgrounds

- For areas/boxes: try desaturated bright (= pastel) colors

- An outline in the same color, but darker, can look good

- But also dark boxes (again, desaturated) can make sense

### Graphics

- Layering improves the quality of graphics
- Best example : maps

### Data presentation : Viewgraphs, tables

- Title, x-label, y-label need to be there  
- Fonts large enough  
- Enough contrast (e.g., no yellow on white please)  
- Proper number format (where appropriate)  
- Proper type of plot (line, bars, properly ordered)  
- Shades of the blocks can be attractive, but don't overuse
- [Tables](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~pueschel/teaching/guides/guide-tables.pdf )(Omitted due to lack of time)

### Visualization

- Visual quality is sometimes as important as technical contents
- Too much text / Only text conflicts with your talking 
- Try to minimize texts and learn to talk free from text.
- Add some animations if things get completed, but don't fancify
- Show what you are talking directly and avoid just talking it verbally
  - You may use Block Diagrams, Procedures, Input/Output Specification or more.

## Present

### Start your talk 

- with an interesting slide
- Introduce yourself
- Acknowledge your co-authors

### While Presenting

- Trying to avoid a text slide 
- People can easily get distracted by their communication devices. Just being boring for 2-3 mins will ruin the whole presentation.
- Speak clearly, not too fast
- Look at the audience
- Do not put your hands in your pockets or cross your arms
- Repeat one or two key points throughout the presentation
- Use some humor if you can
- Repeating overview slides to help to reinitialize people
  - *"I just explained ...; Now we will..."*

### Content Organization

- **Motivation** -- What? Why? Why important?

  Try to:

  - make a precise problem statement
  - Hint the idea of your solution
  - Example a good result

- **Overview**

  - \>25mins : It should repeat every section
  - <=20mins : It should only show once
  - <=10mins : No overview

- **Background** and related work

  - Acknowledge verbally

- Your **contribution**

- **Results**

- **Conclusions**

  - Repeat main ideas / results / messages

- (Optional) Backup Slides for Q&A (Providing additional data or the explanations of the questions you expect)

### The importance of presentation

- You present your work and yourself : Presentations are a unique chance to connect your work with your person  

- Be well prepared
  - Charge the device used for presenting & Bring the power cord
  - Boot the device in advance and make sure it's up to date
  - Make a backup of the presentation
  - Get a remote mouse for free talking
  - Be reasonably dressed
  
- 2-3 minutes is a comforting time for a slide, which is applied to all.

- Things you should avoid

  - Trying to communicate every detail of your work ---- People cannot digest that much
  - Too many slides
  - Over-packed slides
  - Purposely make easy things complicated
